## Overview

null is a member-led organization. Members serve as Leaders, and volunteers for our community. Members have a vote in the election of null Leadership. Membership is a privilege guided by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/null-open-security-community/Documentation/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which has dues set by the null Leadership, and are detailed below.

## Membership

Membership is explicitly defined as people that pay dues. Nearly all null activities are open to both members and nonmembers. Some example activities include participating in a Project or Chapter, attending chapter meetings, joining mailing lists or attending events. Merely participating in the activities of the null organization does not make that person a Member; membership includes only those who pay dues to the null organization.

Individual Members can check their Membership Status, renewal dates, and update their billing information by sending an email to [membership-support@null.community](mailto:membership-support@null.community).

Members in “good standing” are defined as those who have paid dues appropriate with their membership level while also not subject to any disciplinary action(s) by the null organization.

While the null organization will make diligent efforts to inform members of their membership - in particular expiration dates - it is the sole responsibility of the member to manage their membership and renewals.
