# Guidelines for Chapter Leads who use a local chapter FB Page

A few chapter leads feel that having a local chapter page on FB makes it easy to manage the chapter and engage with the community members. Since bunch of such chapter pages are already existing, we are going ahead with this. It is completely up to the chapter leaders for a chapter to choose whether to create and use such a page or not.

We would like to maintain a few guidelines for the creation & use of such pages

Display image to contain the null logo in some form.
Header image to contain the null logo in some form.
The FB page needs to explain clearly that this is a smaller city specific page, part of null and also point to the main null0x00 FB page.
All uploaded images and media needs to be public so that it can be shared with everyone easily.
Chapter leaders need to be prepared to share common news annoucements, event annoucements as and when required by null0x00.
The group should make it easy for members to find the official sources of information including the blog, mailing list and any other medium which is deemed as official for dissemination of news.
No product or company promotion allowed at all.
Only topics allowed for discussion are information security related, chapter related etc.
